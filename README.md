# Sales Prediction with Random Forest

## Overview
This project implements a sales prediction model using the Random Forest algorithm, enhanced through hyperparameter tuning. The model predicts future sales based on advertising expenditures across various platforms, providing valuable insights for businesses in optimizing their marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes information about sales and advertising spend across different media:
- **TV**: Advertising spend on television
- **Radio**: Advertising spend on radio
- **Newspaper**: Advertising spend on newspapers
- **Sales**: Actual sales figures

You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv).

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Results
The performance of the Random Forest model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- R-squared Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Visualizations include:
- Scatter plot of predicted vs. actual sales
- Histogram of prediction errors

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in sales prediction tasks, particularly when optimized through hyperparameter tuning. The insights gained from the model can assist businesses in making data-driven decisions to enhance their advertising strategies.
